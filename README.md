Example of an application to manage teachers schedules.

This is an application in response for a little school project. The aim was to developp an mobile application to help teachers of the University to manage their schedules.

By the way, the main features of the application are looking for a classroom, adding a course in the schedules, deleting the course, etc.
Teachers are also able to manage the marks of their students.

This application doesn't use any connection to network, the features are tested whith raw data.

The code of this application is pushed on github to help people with many ways to create and use gridlayouts, events and slide menu.
